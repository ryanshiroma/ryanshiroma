### Hello, Hello!
I'm currently a data scientist at Sense360 working with transaction and foot traffic location data. Formerly a data scientist at Capital One doing credit risk modeling. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanshiroma/">

</a>

Most of my repos are collections of disjointed code that I work on in my spare time to support my addictions to Strava
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/1541605">
  <img align="center" alt="LinkedIn" width="22px" src="strava_symbol_orange.png" />
</a> and Chevy Bolt ðŸš™ data. 

I'm currently interested/working on:
 - ConvNet Astros Trash Can Detector
   - modeling work is complete but code is not cleaned up. documentation is in progress.
 - [BoltStats API](https://github.com/ryanshiroma/boltstats)
   - REST API built on AWS to export and analyze my.chevrolet.com data for my Chevy Bolt EV 
 - [Strava-analyzer](https://github.com/ryanshiroma/strava-analyzer)
   -  building out additional functionality to analyze activity streams.



 - Rasberry Pi OBDII data collector
   - my.chevrolet.com is rather limited so I'm planning to pull data directly from the car itself and connect it up to my personal [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) server. I haven't started yet but I'm excited to start my first IoT project!
